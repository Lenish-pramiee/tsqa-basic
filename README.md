# training

We will use this repository to share work we are doing on training.
This directory is used to learn python.Our goal is to calculate the BMI of the user and
check the user category(Underweight,normal weight,over weight and obese).By reading the 
CSV file we can compare the user BMI with player BMI which is given in the dataset.

By using the same program you can learn Python simple input/output,funtions,
reading CSV files, exceptional handling and classes.
